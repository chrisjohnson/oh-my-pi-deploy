# Seed oh-my-pi's model config ONCE, only if it doesn't already exist — same
# non-stomping convention as pi-web/docker-entrypoint.sh (which seeds pi-web's
# models.json at $PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR). omp reads its provider registry from
# $PI_CONFIG_DIR/agent/models.yml (YAML preferred; .yaml fallback; a legacy
# models.json at the same path is auto-migrated to YAML on first load), so this
# seeds the native YAML path. Unlike pi-web, omp has no in-session Models panel
# that writes this same file, but the seed-once convention is kept anyway: omp's
# /models and plugin flows both mutate config under the agent dir, and a config
# the user deliberately edited should not be resurrected on every restart.
#
# Guard is deliberately stricter than "does models.yml exist": seeding a fresh
# models.yml when the user already has models.yaml (the fallback) or a legacy
# models.json would create a higher-precedence file that silently shadows what
# they configured. Skip seeding if any of the three exists.
